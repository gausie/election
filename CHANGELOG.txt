Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-28
-----------------------
- The previously undocumented hook hook_election_results_page_alter() now no
  longer provides $totals as a parameter. The function
  election_results_get_totals() has been added.
- The function election_referendum_count_votes_by_answer() has been added.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-19
-----------------------
- Issue #1994932 by ricky.middaugh: Added a setting to show or hide the
  Candidates tab on an election.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-16
-----------------------
- Issue #1995704: Added hook_election_candidate_post_has_enough_alter(),
  allowing other modules to help determine whether a post has 'enough'
  candidates for voting to be possible. See
  election_candidate/election_candidate.api.php for details.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-05-05
-----------------------
- Election editors are now able to add candidates via an 'Add new candidate'
  form. So the permissions 'bypass nomination schedule', 'bypass nomination
  exclusivity', and 'allow duplicate nominations' have now been removed as they
  are no longer useful. The form ID 'election_candidate_edit_form' has been
  changed to 'election_candidate_form'.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-04-13
-----------------------
- Tagged as 7.x-1.0-beta14: as a consequence of the previous change (see below),
  many internal simplifications to the Election Condition submodule have been
  made, including the removal of a database table. If you have previously had
  the Election Condition module enabled, you will need to run update.php (or
  drush updb).

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-03-25
-----------------------
- API change in Election Vote module: removed hook_election_vote_access() and
  replaced it with hook_election_vote_before_grant(), which takes one less
  parameter. There is also a new Rules event, 'Before granting access to vote',
  and the corresponding action 'Deny voting access'. See election_vote.api.php.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-27
-----------------------
- API change: removed 'save votes' callbacks, replacing them with a new hook,
  hook_election_vote_ELECTION_TYPE_save(). See election_vote.api.php.
- API change: a 'vote form' callback now has the same function signature as
  hook_form_alter(). See election.api.php.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-24
-----------------------
- Many changes to theme-related things such as render arrays, theme functions,
  and some string changes and CSS tweaks.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-17
-----------------------
- Removed Views field handler linking elections to their candidates tab.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-26
-----------------------
- New submodule: election_export, which takes over the ballot file (.blt) export
  functionality which used to live in the election_stv submodule.
- API change: hook_election_type_info() used to ask for 'results download form'
  which is now no longer used. The key 'export' (Boolean) now defines whether
  results can be exported & downloaded. This requires the election_export module
  to be enabled, and the election type needs to support candidates. See
  election.api.php.
- API change: hook_election_type_info() used to ask for 'results page' which is
  now no longer used. To change the results page, modules should implement
  hook_election_results_page_alter(&$output, $post, $totals). But this will soon
  be replaced by a theme preprocess hook.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-16
-----------------------
- Default stats groups in theme_election_statistics() are now arrays, not
  stdClass objects. See election_statistics_get_totals().

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-05
-----------------------
- Changed the default name of referendum posts from 'motions' to 'questions'.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-03
-----------------------
- Issue #1856998: converted the 'Thank you for voting' and 'You have abstained'
  messages into default Rules.
- Issue #1841644 - added 'Elected' and 'Defeated' as candidate statuses. They
  have no special meaning or effect, yet.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-09-05
-----------------------
- Added a 'candidate types' admin system. You will need to run database updates
  (API change).
- The above means that nomination forms are now per post, not per election (UI
  change).
- Removed the 'phone' column from the election_candidate table, adding a default
  Field instead.
